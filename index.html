<b>Get to Know Me!</b> 
<br>
<p>Hello! My name is Natalie Peña, and I am a high school junior at LREI. 
Here a five things about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I live in Brooklyn</li>
        <li>I want to live in Europe when I'm older</li>
        <li>I want three puppies when I have my own apartment</li>
        <li>I am sixteen years old</li>
        <li>Mac and cheese is my favorite food</li>
    </ul>
                        
<p>In this web design course, I would like to learn everything I need 
to know in order to be able to code fluently! I wasn't sure this 
was something that I would like but now that I have been doing it for
a month or so, I know that it is something that I am interested in. 
It would be really cool to know how to code perfectly!

is my favorite web page that I've coded so far. </p>
