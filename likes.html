                    <p>Ashley's <i>bestdressed</i> YouTube channel is one
                    of my favorites. Most of her videos have to do with 
                    fashion or home decor, but she makes a lot of videos
                    about painting, thrifting, hauls, and more. She's really
                    talented; she won the senior superlative for best dressed, 
                    which is a feat in and of itself, and her wardrobe and 
                    outfits show why. Also, she can do incredible things with a 
                    sewing machine. If I had her sense of style, a good source
                    of my stress would vanish.</p>

                        <p><i>Jane ASMR</i> is my favorite ASMR channel. I get that 
                            a lot of people get grossed out by the sound of 
                            people chewing, and honestly, me too. It's one of my
                            pet peeves. But for some reason, it doesn't bother me
                            when I listen to it. In fact, it really helps me focus
                            when I'm doing homework. The video shown is the one
                            I'm listening to as I type these words. Jane ASMR is the 
                            only one I listen to because she never talks in the 
                            video, only ever eats her food, so I can just add all
                            her videos on my queue and not have to worry about
                            eventually needing to stop what I'm doing to skip 
                            past the talking parts.

                        <p>A final channel that I like to watch a lot is <i>Vogue</i>.
                            They have a lot of interesting series, but my favorite
                            ones are <i>Diary of a Model</i>, <i>73 Questions</i>, and
                            <i>24 Hours With</i>. The
                            video shown is part of the <i>Diary of a Model</i> series,
                            and it follows top model Anok Yai around a busy day 
                            during New York Fashion Week. I like this video 
                            especially because it makes the models seem more human
                            instead of this far-away, perfect object, and it really
                            shows their personality.
