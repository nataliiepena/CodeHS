            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Natalie Pe√±a, and I am a high school junior at LREI. 
            Here a five things about me:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I live in Brooklyn</li>
                    <li>I want to live in Europe when I'm older</li>
                    <li>I want three puppies when I have my own apartment</li>
                    <li>I am sixteen years old</li>
                    <li>Mac and cheese is my favorite food</li>
                </ul>
                        
            <p>In this web design course, I would like to learn everything I need 
            to know in order to be able to code fluently! I wasn't sure this 
            was something that I would like but now that I have been doing it for
            a month or so, I know that it is something that I am interested in. 
            It would be really cool to know how to code perfectly! 
            <a href="https://codehs.com/editor/html/415415/1315627/index.html">This</a> 
            is my favorite web page that I've coded so far. </p>
