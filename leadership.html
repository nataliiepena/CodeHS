        <h2>LEADERSHIP</h2>
        
            <p>
                I've been taking initiative in classrooms and schools since
                I was in elementary school, from being in student government
                in the fifth grade to taking care of the kindergarteners in 
                the fourth grade. Explore this page to find out what I'm up 
                to now.

                            <h3>CLUBS</h3>
                            <p>I'm very proud to say I was given the oppurtunity
                            to lead one of the clubs that I've been a part of for 
                            quite a while at my school! Read more below:

                                <h4>FEMINISM IS FOR EVERYBODY</h4>
                                    <p>
                                    I co-lead the feminism club at my school. We meet
                                    once a week, but our work extends beyond the classroom 
                                    we meet in. Whether it's bringing the conversations that
                                    emerge from that week's topic or documentary back to 
                                    our homes and friends, or putting up messages about rape
                                    culture on school bulletin boards, the work we do is 
                                    difficult, transformative, and necessary.

                                <p>At my time so far at LREI, I've led multiple 
                                school-wide drives. Check them out:</p>
                        
                            <h4>HOLIDAY DRIVE</h4>
                                <img class="drives" src="https://i.imgur.com/XapLzrU.jpg">
                                <p>The winter of my freshman year, three of my friends and I
                                ran a Holiday Drive for children at the NYU's Hospital for
                                Joint Diseases. </p>
                            <h4>YELLOWHAMMER FUND</h4>
                                <img class="drives" src="https://i.imgur.com/JmC1A5G.jpg">
                                <p>During the spring of my sophomore year, in response to the 
                                abortion rights being rolled back across the country my 
                                feminist club held a bake sake in our school's front lobby. 
                                All of proceeds went to the Yellowhammer fund, an organization
                            in Alabama (the state where the most restictive bill was passed)
                                that provides funding for anyone seeking an abortion in one of 
                                Alabama's three clinics.</p> 
                            <h4>SANITARY PRODUCT DRIVE</h4>
                                <img class="drives" src="https://i.imgur.com/R264EYJ.png">
                                <p>Towards the end of the first trimester of my junior year,
                                LREI partook in a menstrual drive along with sixteen other
                                private schools in New York City. Along with a friend, I
                                repped the drive at LREI. After putting up posters, boxes,
                                sending out emails and making announcements, when the schools
                                came together we had a collective number of 10,000 pads and tampons
                                to send to <i>Cruzando Fronteras</i>, an organization that aids 
                                families on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexican border while 
                                they await movement on their US immigration and asylum pensions.

                                <p>
                                I've been lucky enough to have been able to take part in 
                                multiple diversity initiatives outside of my school, regionally
                                and nationally. 
                                </p>
                            <h4>DAIS</h4>
                            <p>Since the May of my sophomore year, I have been a part of the 
                                DAIS community, which stands for the Diveristy Awareness 
                                Initiative for Students. We meet monthly with students from 
                                various New York City private schools to have conversations
                                varying topics, such as stereotypes and our experience at our 
                                schools, intent vs. impact within social media, and generational
                                experiences of the youth, to name a few. 
                                
                            <h4>SDLC</h4>
                                <img class="drives" src="https://i.imgur.com/UzsxUcd.jpg">
                                <p>During December of my junior year, four other students and I 
                                were selected to represent our school at the 2019 Student 
                                Diversity Leadership Conference (SDLC), which was being held
                                in Seattle, Washington that year. Students who attend private
                                schools from all over the United States and a select other
                                countries got together and spoke about our experiences at our
                                private schools, noticing the similarities in our plights and 
                                brainstorming ways to bring back what we learned and transforming
                                it into change at our private schools. My time at SDLC was ablsolutely
                                amazing and I am incredibly grateful to have been able to take part 
                                in such a transformative experience.
